# Cplusplus

For this project, The Corner Grocer, a customer, came to me requesting a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. The grocer is rearranging their product sectin and need to know how often certain items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. The grocer has asked for three things to be included in the program: 
  1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
  2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
  3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

Within this project, I combined C++ and python to produce a program that would output what the Corner Grocer was asking for. I did this particulary well and successfully produced the correct output. One thing that I could have done differently is add in more comment lines. Comments are incredibly useful for all progrmas as it makes it easier to reuse code and how to do so. 

I found the Python portion most difficult to write. I looked over my resources from my Python course and at my textbook for more information on how to write in the Python language again. I also found a 24/7 online tutoring center to support me if my code was producing a specific error. They will be added to my support network. Although this project was difficult, I found the skills to combine Python with C++ very useful for future projects. Having this knowledge will only benefit me in the future.
